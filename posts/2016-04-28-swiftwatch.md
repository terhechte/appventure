And now for something slightly different. I\'m not sure how others
perceive this, but I find it very difficult to keep on track of all the
exciting developments in the Swift community. There\'re so many
fascinating GitHub projects, valuable conference talks, educational blog
posts, insightful Twitter discussions and fantastic newsletters that it
is hard to keep yourself updated on recent developments. To make matters
worse, the scope of Swift is also expanding from iOS/watchOS/tvOS/macOS
development to Linux server development and now even Android
development.

There\'re several great [Swift](https://twitter.com/SwiftSandbox) &
[iOS](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/245?#start) newsletters that
remedy this situation in part, but they only appear once a week and
usually showcase a limited, curated selection of what happened during
the week. There\'s also the [reddit
Swift](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/) community, but the myriad of
subreddits (like iOS, Mac, programming, etc), again, requires the
visiting of multiple different locations in order to get an overview
[^1].

After feeling constantly overwhelmed and underinformed, I decided to try
to do something about this. I\'m an avid reader of [Hacker
News](http://news.ycombinator.com), and, to me, it feels as if what\'s
missing is a place like Hacker News [^2] but solely for everything
Swift. A place to share interesting Swift tidbits and (maybe) discuss
them.

So without further ado, let me introduce
[**SwiftWatch**](http://swiftwatch.net):

<div align="center">
<a href="http://swiftwatch.net">
<img src="/img-content/swiftwatch.png" srcset="/img-content/swiftwatch@2x.png 2x" style="box-shadow: 6px 6px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); border-radius: 4px;" /><br/>
<br/>
</a>
<br/>
<br/>
</div>

[SwiftWatch](http://swiftwatch.net) tries to be this place. I\'d not
call it a community or a social network. Rather, it is a place to share
interesting Swift news. You have to register with a Twitter or Github
account, in order to (ever so slightly) decrease the likelihood of spam.
Commenting is possible, but I don\'t envision this site to be a source
of great discussions. Instead, I\'d be more than happy if people start
using it to post interesting Swift developments.

If you have any feedback regarding Swiftwatch, feel free [to contact me
on Twitter.](http://swiftwatch.net)

As you can see, [@renelindhorst](https://twitter.com/renelindhorst) [^3]
and I have already been feeding the page with a couple of links which we
deemed interesting enough to post them.

The site is based on [Monocle](http://monocle.io), an open source link
sharing platform. I\'d have rather developed something in Swift but
that\'d have consumed too much time. If SwiftWatch survives (i.e. if it
gains decent traction) then I\'d seriously consider rewriting the guts
in Swift3 + one of those nice Web Frameworks (like
[Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect)).

Thanks for reading!

PS: In case you\'re wondering \"SwiftWatch\" is named after the peculiar
habbit of [birdwatching,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching)
\"a form of wildlife observation in which the observation of birds is a
recreational activity\". I found this a particularly good fit as the
core objective of this site is quite similar.

[^1]: Alternatively, one can sign up on reddit and meticulously manage
    one\'s subreddit subscriptions, but not everybody does that

[^2]: or LamerNews or Designer News or Product Hunt
