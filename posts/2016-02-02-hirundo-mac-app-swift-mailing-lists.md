If you\'re interested in Swift, the mailing lists are a fantastic
resource.
[Swift-Evolution](https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution)
discusses the future of the language and includes many interesting
messages about the shape that the language may become. Following it also
really helps understanding the bigger idea behind many of Swift\'s most
interesting features.
[Swift-Dev](https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-dev), on the
other hand, goes down into the details of how Swift works internally. If
that\'s not your thing, there\'s
[Swift-Users](https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users)
which covers questions and discussions about Swift from a user /
programmers point of view.

Following those lists is not only useful, but also brings tremendous
benefits. However, following them is also kinda hard:

-   The web archive is not easy to navigate
-   When you subscribe to a list you\'re bound to the UI of a mailing
    list / your Mail app
-   You can\'t see any messages posted before you subscribed
-   Many convenience functions (Bookmarks, Muting, etc) are not
    available

This bugged me. I wanted to be able to follow the discussions there, but
I\'d rather have a nice UI for them. So over Christmas I started working
on a small app to solve this dilemma.

# Enter **Hirundo**

<div align="center">

</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</div>

Hirundo is the result of this (Written in Swift, of course). The word is
latin and means Sparrow or Swift, so I thought it\'d be a nice fit and
it sounds cool. There\'s also an accompanying website for the app under
[stylemac.com/hirundo](https://stylemac.com/hirundo).

The app is currently in beta as I\'m trying to iron out the remaining
bugs. I\'m already very happy with how it turned out and with the
current set of implemented features. Among other things, the app
supports:

-   Follow multiple Swift lists
-   Browse and search everything posted to the lists
-   Detailed search facilities over all messages in all lists
-   You can mute threads so that they don\'t appear in the lists anymore
-   If you are subscribed to a list, Hirundo will open Mail.app with
    reply headers set
-   Read messages from selected authors, search for authors, or even
    manage favorite authors
-   Sort messages by various properties, including a Rank showcasing the
    most discussed threads
-   Messages are threaded, you can fold them or collapse them
-   Bookmark any message or thread into multiple folders and revisit
    them later
-   Reply to threads or start new threads

# Building it

Writing the app took longer than I initially expected. I sometimes tend
to be naive about technical limitations and so I just started working on
this app without really assessing the difficulty of implementing it. The
biggest issue was that the Swift mailing list data is not available via
a REST API or something which else that one could query. There\'re only
two ways of accessing the data:

## Parsing the HTML archives

However this has several drawbacks. It requires a **ton** of `HTTP`
requests, and it is very slow crawling the server for them. Those `HTML`
pages use very simple, non-semantic `HTML` which makes it difficult and
error prone to parse them correctly. Even worse, it lacks certain data
which is required to properly establish the message tree afterwards.

## Parsing the mailing archives

This is what I used. The archives are in the Unix `mbox` format so
there\'s a way better chance of parsing them properly. They also contain
all the information required to build up the message threads afterwards.
I decided to use [MailCore 2](https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2) for
the actual parsing of the mails in the `mbox` so that I\'d not need to
reimplement another [RFC2822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822)
parser. However, a couple of small differences between RFC2822 and the
mbox format generated by
[pipermail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Mailman)[^1] required
additional effort in order to properly format the mbox contents so that
MailCore could read them. The messages are then read, parsed, converted,
and finally placed in Core Data.

# Real Time Messages

After playing with the app for a while, I realized that the mailing list
archives were not updated in real time. Instead, the compressed archives
are only generated once a day. This makes the whole approach obsolete
for actual following the discussions. This was also when I realized I
should have invested more time up front researching this. Since the
`HTML` was not feasible for import I was at an impasse. The solution, it
seemed, was to host the temporary real time messages myself.

The next step (again, this took way longer than expected) was setting up
an `smtp` email server which receives mails to mailing lists that I
subscribe it to, and writes them out into the `mbox` format. A small
webserver then offers those files as temporary caches of current mailing
list activity. As soon as the official mailing list archives are
updated, the cached ones are deleted[^2]. If you\'re running [Little
Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) this is
what happens when you see Hirundo download data from
`hirundo-lists.stylemac.com`.

# Replying to Messages or creating Threads

When you click **reply** or **new** Hirundo opens your standard mail
client with a `mailto:` call embedding all required mail headers for a
proper reply. However **Mail.app** does not respect one of the required
headers (`In-Reply-To`) so I had to use the (`References`) alternative
header instead. That is a working solution but not optimal as it makes
it more difficult for Pipermail (the mailing list) to properly thread
your reply to the correct location. Other mail clients (such as
Thunderbird) don\'t seem to have this problem. A future solution would
be to send the mail directly from within Hirundo.

# Building the UI

Once that finally worked, I started working on the UI of the app. I
decided to limit it to 10.11 El Capitan, so that I could play around
with all the new and exciting technologies released last WWDC. As it
happens, I haven\'t even reached 1.0 and there\'s already a list of
upcoming refactorings I\'d like to perform as some initial design
decisions were not as good as I thought they\'d be in hindsight.

# Mac App Development

I wrote a couple of interesting small classes for this project, and
I\'ll spend the next posts on appventure building a simple Mac App based
on some of the Hirundo code. There\'s currently a certain lack of Swift
OSX development information, and I\'d like to fill this void a bit.

[^2]: There\'s a certain chance that, given the right timing, a message
    may not end up in Hirundo until one day later
