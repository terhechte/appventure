# Finishing Words

Pattern Matching is a really powerful feature of Swift. It is one of the defining features that makes Swift Code so much nicer to read than what you'd write in Objective-C. It is also deeply integrated into the language as it can be used with `let`, `guard`, `for`, `if`, and `switch`. It also allows adding `where` clauses, using `is` or `as` for type casts, lets you extend it via `~=` and much more.
