# API Endpoints

Rest APIs are a great use case for enums. They\'re naturally grouped,
they\'re limited to a finite set of APIs, and they may have additional
query or named parameters which can be modelled through associated
values.

Take, for example, a look at a simplified version of the [**Instagram
API**](https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/)

``` Swift
enum Instagram {
  enum Media {
    case popular
    case shortcode(id: String)
    case search(lat: Float, 
                min_timestamp: Int, 
                lng: Float, 
                max_timestamp: Int, 
                distance: Int)
  }
  enum Users {
    case user(id: String)
    case feed
    case recent(id: String)
  }
}
```

[Ash Furrow\'s **Moya** library](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) is based
around this idea of using `enums` to map rest endpoints.
