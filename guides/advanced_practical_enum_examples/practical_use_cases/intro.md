# Practical Usecases

We\'ve already seen a couple of useful `enums` in the previous feature
descriptions. Examples would be `Optional`, `Either`,
`FileNode`, or the binary tree. However, there\'re many more scenarios
where using an `enum` wins over a `struct` or `class`. Usually, if your
problem domain can be divided into a finite set of distinctive
categories, an `enum` may be the right choice. Even only two cases are a
perfectly valid scenario for an enum, as the Optional and Either types
show.

Here, then, are some more examples of practical `enum` usage to fuel
your creativity.
