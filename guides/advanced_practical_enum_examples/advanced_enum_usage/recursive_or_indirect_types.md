# Recursive / Indirect Types

Indirect types are a new addition that came with Swift 2.0. They allow
you to define enums where the associated value of a `case` is the very
same enum again. As an example, consider that you want to define a file
system representations with files and folders containing files. If
**File** and **Folder** were enum cases, then the **Folder** case would
need to have an array of **File** cases as it\'s associated value. Since
this is a recursive operation, the compiler has to make special
preparations for it. Quoting from the Swift documentation:

> Enums and cases can be marked indirect, which causes the associated
> value for the enum to be stored indirectly, allowing for recursive
> data structures to be defined.

So to implement our **FileNode** `enum`, we\'d have to write it like
this:

``` Swift
enum FileNode {
  case File(name: String)
  indirect case Folder(name: String, files: [FileNode])
}
```

The `indirect` keyword tells the compiler to handle this `enum case`
indirectly. You can also add the keyword for the whole enum. [As an
example imagine mapping a binary
tree](http://airspeedvelocity.net/2015/07/22/a-persistent-tree-using-indirect-enums-in-swift/):

``` Swift
indirect enum Tree<Element: Comparable> {
    case Empty
    case Node(Tree<Element>,Element,Tree<Element>)
}
```

This is a very powerful feature that allows you to map complex
relationships in a very clean way with an enum.
