# Intro

Even before Swift was released, iOS / Cocoa developers could use third
party frameworks like ObjectiveSugar or ReactiveCocoa in order to gain
functional programming constructs like `map`, `flatMap` or `filter`.
With Swift, they have become first class language citizens. There are
many advantages to using them over a standard `for` loop. They typically
express your intent better, they require less code, and they can be
chained together in order to build up complex logic in a clear way.

In this post, I\'d like to show another very cool functional addition to
Swift which can sometimes be a better solution than `map` / `filter`
constructs: `reduce`.
