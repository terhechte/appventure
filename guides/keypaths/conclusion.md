# Conclusion

We've seen how the Swift `KeyPath` type can be used to define abstractions that would otherwise not be possible with just protocols or generics. As with everything in Swift, the beauty is how you can combine the different patterns, be it `KeyPath`, or `protocol`, or `generics` and use them to solve problems in new and exciting kind of ways. With each release, Swift introduces more and better features that help us do this. KeyPaths are one of those nice additions that simplify development in many ways.
