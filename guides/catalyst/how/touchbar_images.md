Apple has a very nice set of default touchbar images outlined here:

- [https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/touch-bar/touch-bar-icons-and-images/](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/touch-bar/touch-bar-icons-and-images/)
- [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstouchbaritem?language=objc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstouchbaritem?language=objc)

These currently can't be used in Catalyst apps (FB6312494).
