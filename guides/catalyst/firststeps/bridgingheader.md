# How do I use the touchbar or toolbar classes firststeps/bridgingheader.md

There is one issue on beta 2 which means that you need to add a *bridging header* to your project and import a header file in there if you want to use the `NSTouchbar` or `NSToolbar` APIs.

1. Add a new bridging header to your project, say `bridge-me.h` (If you don't have a bridging header yet)
2. In your target Build Settings set the `Objective-C Bridging Header` value to your new bridging header ("MyApp/bridge-me.h")

Make sure to have the right path for the bridging header.

## Then, insert the following code in your bridging header:

``` C
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <UIKit/NSToolbar+UIKitAdditions.h>
#import <UIKit/NSTouchbar+UIKitAdditions.h>
```
