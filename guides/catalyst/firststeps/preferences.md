In order to implement the preferences or your app, [Apple supports the *Settings.bundle* technology that has been there since iOS 2.0 (or rather, iPhoneOS 2.0)](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/UserDefaults/Preferences/Preferences.html). The documentation is actually so old, that it is archived and the documentation screenshots look like this:

On iOS, this means that you just need to add a new bundle target to your project and fill it with a collection of specially crafted `Plist` files. These settings then appear in the general iOS settings and any changes done there are stored in the `NSUserDefaults`.

If your app supports settings bundles, then your Catalyst app will automatically add a Preferences window to your app that looks something like this:

For details on how to achieve this, [refer to Apples documentation.](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/UserDefaults/Preferences/Preferences.html)

Now, if you have more involved logic in your settings, special view controllers, web views, and other things, then this doesn't work well for you. [In that case, you can read here how to implement more complex preferences on macOS.](how/logic_preferences.md)
