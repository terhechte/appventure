Many of the macOS specific UIKit extensions require you to use a scene delegate. If your project was created before iOS 13 and you also don't intend to use multiple windows, you can follow these steps to add a scene delegate to your project and keep the app limited to one window:

The first step is to add a scene manifest to your `Info.plist`. [This can either be done in the Xcode plist editor](/img-content/catalyst/scene_manifest.png) or by adding the following lines to your `Info.plist` in source code mode (You can just keep the default names. They're fine):

``` XML
<key>UIApplicationSceneManifest</key>
<dict>
	<key>UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes</key>
	<true/>
	<key>UISceneConfigurations</key>
	<dict>
		<key>UIWindowSceneSessionRoleApplication</key>
		<array>
			<dict>
				<key>UILaunchStoryboardName</key>
				<string>LaunchScreen</string>
				<key>UISceneConfigurationName</key>
				<string>Default Configuration</string>
				<key>UISceneDelegateClassName</key>
				<string>$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).SceneDelegate</string>
				<key>UISceneStoryboardFile</key>
				<string>Main</string>
			</dict>
		</array>
	</dict>
</dict>
```

Next, add the following two functions to your `AppDelegate`. Note that only one of them is used, but for posterity, it makes sense to add both in one go:

``` swift
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, configurationForConnecting connectingSceneSession: UISceneSession, options: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) -> UISceneConfiguration {
        // Called when a new scene session is being created.
        // Use this method to select a configuration to create the new scene with.
        return UISceneConfiguration(name: "Default Configuration", sessionRole: connectingSceneSession.role)
    }

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didDiscardSceneSessions sceneSessions: Set<UISceneSession>) {
        // Called when the user discards a scene session.
        // If any sessions were discarded while the application was not running, this will be called shortly after application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.
        // Use this method to release any resources that were specific to the discarded scenes, as they will not return.
    }
```

Finally, add a new file, `SceneDelegate.swift` to your project and add the following code to it:

``` swift
import UIKit

class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
        // Use this method to optionally configure and attach the UIWindow `window` to the provided UIWindowScene `scene`.
        // If using a storyboard, the `window` property will automatically be initialized and attached to the scene.
        // This delegate does not imply the connecting scene or session are new (see `application:configurationForConnectingSceneSession` instead).
        guard let _ = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
    }
}
```

By default, apple also adds the following, empty, methods to a new `UIWindowSceneDelegate` conforming class, but you don't necessarily need them and can always add them later:

``` swift
func sceneDidDisconnect(_ scene: UIScene)
func sceneDidBecomeActive(_ scene: UIScene)
func sceneWillResignActive(_ scene: UIScene)
func sceneWillEnterForeground(_ scene: UIScene)
func sceneDidEnterBackground(_ scene: UIScene)
```
