* Brief
** TODO tags from guide chapters should also be listed in the tag-content list
** DONE have the article left image only display if there is one (doom)
** DONE use the pagination footer from the chapters
** TODO there're sometimes org markdown tags in the desc (=lala=) etc
** DONE related articles
** TODO HTML in content did not survive the conversion
** TODO Use more 'monokai'i background color for code
* Design
** DONE Reconsider the "Articles" layout. Maybe something with more whitespace?

** TODO "list view" for all chapters in a guide
** DONE "list view" for all posts for a tag

  https://intellij-rust.github.io/2019/03/04/changelog-93.html

* Content
** TODO Use emoji for each guide
** TODO use the keywords for the "Swift Topics"
** TODO alternative to the screenshots
** TODO New sections
Language => My tuple, pattern matching, etc posts
Projects / Examples / Tutorials => Go by example, apps, etc (maybe even stuff like how to read with iPhone 6s what the CPU is)
Tooling = > Swift Package Manager, etc
Blog => Stuff like Expanding Swift's Reach
** TODO add swift version of article (i.e. 4.2 or 5.0) to meta of article so I can display it
** TODO Fix links
some guides still contain links to other guides (either via https://appventure or if it was within one post via #lala) this has to be fixed
** TODO advanced_tuples/intro.md no content yet
** TODO Make sure all code compiles
** TODO The rest ends up in the "Articles" section => Value Types, Useful Optional Extensions
Maybe write a tool that spits out code which doesn't compile?
** TODO Auto-inject keyword links for 'tuple', 'enum', 'optional', etc with the nice macappblog popup    
** TODO Add backwards compatible links to the old content:
 take the old generated html, and insert a header at the top "APPVENTURE RELAUNCHED" with a link to the new versions of the article,
  and then re-generate it and just keep the old /2015, /2016 etc folders as "copy folders" in (for search engine links and for posterity)


* HTML Stuff
** TODO Debug Responsiveness
** TODO Headline / logo
** TODO About
** TODO social interaction (follow on twitter, etc)

* Future
** TODO Add "Generics" Guide
   
* Done
** DONE Search guides / books / chapters
** DONE Have markdown tag for books for "prev_chapter" and "next_chapter" maybe it is just a js function that is injected into the template.. that would be easier
** DONE Split posts up into multiple smaller posts and make them into books (i.e. pattern matching guide)
** DONE fix syntax highlighting
