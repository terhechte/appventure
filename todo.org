* TODO Add backwards compatible links to the old content:
 take the old generated html, and insert a header at the top "APPVENTURE RELAUNCHED" with a link to the new versions of the article,
  and then re-generate it and just keep the old /2015, /2016 etc folders as "copy folders" in (for search engine links and for posterity)
* The pattenr matching article on old appventure has the wrong link. check the others if links are correct
