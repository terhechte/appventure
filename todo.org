* The terhech.de articles still need to receive the *move* flag
* Write inout article, then generate the old html a last time for inclusion
* Have 'released' and 'updated' flag for the posts, articles, etc
* Make sure have no websocket code in release build
* new chapters in RSSFeed
* the ref-links need to be implemented
* RawRepresentable article
* About page
* Debug reponsiveness (guides right sidebar has to disappear earlier)
* Clicking a guide image doesn't work. only headline works
* TODO Fix links
some guides still contain links to other guides (either via https://appventure or if it was within one post via #lala) this has to be fixed
* TODO Auto-inject keyword links for 'tuple', 'enum', 'optional', etc with the nice macappblog popup    
* TODO Add backwards compatible links to the old content:
 take the old generated html, and insert a header at the top "APPVENTURE RELAUNCHED" with a link to the new versions of the article,
  and then re-generate it and just keep the old /2015, /2016 etc folders as "copy folders" in (for search engine links and for posterity)
