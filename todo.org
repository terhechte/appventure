** TODO Guides
** TODO Have markdown tag for books for "prev_chapter" and "next_chapter" maybe it is just a js function that is injected into the template.. that would be easier
** TODO add swift version of article (i.e. 4.2 or 5.0) to meta of article so I can display it
*** TODO Fix links
some guides still contain links to other guides (either via https://appventure or if it was within one post via #lala) this has to be fixed
*** TODO advanced_tuples/intro.md no content yet
Swift took a lot of inspiration from different programming languages,
and this is something that Python has been doing for years. While the
previous examples mostly showed how to easily get something into a
tuple, destructuring is a swifty way of getting something out of a
tuple, and in line with the `abc` example above, it looks like this:

``` Swift
let (a, b, c) = abc()
print(a)
```

Another example is getting several function calls into one line:

``` Swift
let (a, b, c) = (a(), b(), c())
```

Or, an easy way to swap two values:

``` Swift
var v1: Int
var v2: Int
(v1, v2) = (5, 4)
(a: v1, b: v2) = (a: v2, b: v1) // swapped: v1 == 4, v2 == 5
(v1, v2) = (5, 4)
(a: v1, b: v2) = (b: v1, a: v2) // swapped: v1 == 4, v2 == 5

```

*** TODO Make sure all code compiles
*** TODO Auto-inject keyword links for 'tuple', 'enum', 'optional', etc with the nice macappblog popup    
Maybe write a tool that spits out code which doesn't compile?
** TODO alternative to the screenshots
** TODO New sections
Language => My tuple, pattern matching, etc posts
Projects / Examples / Tutorials => Go by example, apps, etc (maybe even stuff like how to read with iPhone 6s what the CPU is)
Tooling = > Swift Package Manager, etc
Blog => Stuff like Expanding Swift's Reach
** TODO The rest ends up in the "Articles" section => Value Types, Useful Optional Extensions
** TODO Split posts up into multiple smaller posts and make them into books (i.e. pattern matching guide)
** TODO Add "Generics" Guide
** TODO fix syntax highlighting
** TODO Add backwards compatible links to the old content:
 take the old generated html, and insert a header at the top "APPVENTURE RELAUNCHED" with a link to the new versions of the article,
  and then re-generate it and just keep the old /2015, /2016 etc folders as "copy folders" in (for search engine links and for posterity)
